# J-PAS and PFS surveys in the era of dark energy and neutrino mass measurements

This repository is for the Fisher forecast on the sum of neutrino masses and dark energy of J-PAS and PFS. 
The survey specifications, forecast settings and data for various cases can be found in the `code` folder. 
For forecast on dynamical dark energy using a nonfiducial cosmology, codes are stored in `dynamical_DE_nonfid` folder.

If you want to run the code, you have to install the `starfish` package first. 
`starfish` containts the whole pipeline for the Fisher forecast used in this paper.
And it can be reused for forecast of other surveys, if different `settings.py` files provided.
